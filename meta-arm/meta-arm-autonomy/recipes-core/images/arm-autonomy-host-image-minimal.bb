#Â Includes minimal set required to start and manage guest. The xen specific
# modules are not explicitly included as they are built as part of the kernel
# image for performance reasons. It doesn't include all kernel modules to
# reduce the image size. If the kernel-modules packages are needed they can
# be appended to IMAGE_INSTALL in a bbappend.

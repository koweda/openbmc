# This file holds the guest kea dhcp4 server options running on Dom0.
# The "/etc/xen/scripts/vif-post.d/00-vif-xenguest.hook" called in the end of
# the vif-nat script will use this file to generate the final dhcp
# configuration.

# This file is added in the xenguest image and installed in dom0 under
# /etc/xenguest/guests/${guestname}/files/kea-subnet4.json when the guest
# image is created.
# Any customizations to it should be performed by replacing it via a bbappend.

# The \${vif_ip} and \${router_ip} variables are set in
# the vif-nat script context. The \${subnetprefix} and \${mac} variable are set in the
# 00-vif-xenguest.hook script context.

# The "subnet" configuration node is mandatory in order to have the dhcp
# properly running.

# Corstone-700

## Overview

Corstone-700 is a flexible compute architecture combining Cortex-A and Cortex-M
processors and a secure enclave, aimed at building secure IoT SoCs.  There are
machines for both Corstone-700 for Fixed Virtual Platform (`corstone700-fvp`)
and Corstone-700 for MPS3 FPGA (`corstone700-mps3`).

Further details are available in the [User Guide].

## Building

Corstone-700 is tested in 'tiny' configurations, such as `DISTRO="poky-tiny"`.

## Running

For detailed instructions as to how to run the image in a FVP model, or on the
MPS3 board, see the [User Guide].
